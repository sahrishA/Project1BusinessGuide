Submitted by: **Sahrish Afzal**

About this web app: **Overview
Who doesn't love a good list? In this project, you'll create a list-based web app that displays content of your choosing. 
Is it an expose of shady companies, and how much they spend on lobbying? ðŸ‘€ Is it a database of tips and tricks for young entrepreneurs? 
ðŸ’¼ You'll create a web app that displays some interesting data in a list, building out a complete backend that serves static HTML, 
as well as a minimal frontend to serve the data. This app is Guide to Starting Your Business
No matter what stage you are at opening up a business, we have a tutorial for you! Looking to brainstorm business ideas and find your niche?
We can guide you in the right direction! Finding the right partner? Growing your team? Talking to suppliers?
